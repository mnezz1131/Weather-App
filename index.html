              <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature" target="_blank">Temperature</a>is the degree or
                intensity of heat present in a substance or object, especially as expressed according to a comparative
                scale and shown by a thermometer or perceived by touch.
                <p>
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin" target="_blank">Kelvin</a>scale is an absolute
                  temperature scale (obtained by shifting the Celsius scale by −273.15° so that absolute zero coincides
                  with 0 K), is recognized as the international standard for scientific temperature measurement.
                  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius" target="_blank">Celsuis</a>also called centigrade,
                    scale based on 0° for the freezing point of water and 100° for the boiling point of water. Invented
                    in 1742 by the Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius, it is sometimes called the centigrade scale
                    because of the 100-degree interval between the defined points.</p>
                  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit" target="_blank">Fahrenheit</a>is a temperature
                    scale, used primarily in the United States, in which the freezing point of water is 32 degrees and
                    the boiling point 212 degrees. Temperatures in this scale are denoted by °F or, in scientific usage,
                    F alone.</p>

                <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidity" target="_blank">Humidity</a>is a quantity
                  representing the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere or in a gas.</p>
                <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dew_point" target="_blank">Dew Point</a>is the atmospheric
                  temperature (varying according to pressure and humidity) below which water droplets begin to condense
                  and dew can form.</p>

                    pressure</a>also known as atmospheric pressure, is the pressure exerted by the weight of the
                  atmosphere, which at sea level has a mean value of 101,325 pascals (roughly 14.6959 pounds per square
                  inch).</p>

                  direction the wind is blowing and is reported as the orientation from where the wind is blowing. .</p>
                <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_gust" target="_blank">Wind Gust</a>is a sudden, brief
                  increase in speed of the wind. According to U.S. weather observing practice, gusts are reported when
                  the peak wind speed reaches at least 16 knots and the variation in wind speed between the peaks and
                  lulls is at least 9 knots. The duration of a gust is usually less than 20 seconds.</p>
                <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_speed" target="_blank">Wind Speed</a>s a fundamental
                  atmospheric quantity caused by air moving from high to low pressure, usually due to changes in
                  temperature.</p>
